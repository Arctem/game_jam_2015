A voice echoes from above. "Welcome to Vessel XIV. This is Your Captain. I'm sorry I couldn't make it in person but I have a task for you. I've heard rumors of a malicious stowaway hiding onboard the Vessel. I need you to find the stowaway and eliminate the threat. This stowaway is plotting to destroy the ship and needs to be stopped. There is a note on the table to remind you of your task as you search for him or her. We suspect they may be in {}. You are dismissed."
