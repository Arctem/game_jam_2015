For now, I'm trying to go with a layout like this:
room_name::keyword_0;keyword_1;...keyword_n;;'room description';;;
Where it's all in a single line, and each keyword can be done inside the room.
If you have any worries or suggestions, post them on:
github.com/Arctem/game_jam_2015/issues/1

If there are issues with the multiple colons/semicolons, let me know and I'll look for new characters to use instead of the same ones on repeat.

Example:
cafeteria::look;take;;'The cafeteria is full of tables and chairs where the people aboard their vessle eat their food. There is...etc....';;;
